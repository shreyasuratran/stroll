# stroll
The Stroll app promotes environmental sustainability and personal fitness by incentivizing people to walk to destinations instead of driving. A user enters the destination they are walking to and the store offers them coupons for walking there. This promotes a store's or brand's image, while simultaneously motivating individuals to walk to their location.
